## Architecture
The project follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, which promotes separation of concerns and enhances scalability and maintainability:

- **Model**: Contains the app's data and business logic, using a repository for task storage with Room database.
- **ViewModel**: Manages the UI-related data, updating views through LiveData and handling asynchronous operations with Coroutines.
- **View**: Composed of UI elements that observe LiveData changes and reflect updates in real-time.
